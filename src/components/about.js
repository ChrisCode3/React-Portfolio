      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>
      I've always had a fascination with movies, stories and visuals. I express this love by doing photography and in particular analog photography.
      It reminds us of a long gone past, with it's faded colours and unique textures. 
      We slow down and enjoy the moment and capture it forever in film..
